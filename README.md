# autonomous_mapping_rover
This repository is for (ideally) all files related to an autonomous rover project, including STLs and Arduino source code files. 
The goal of the project is to build a small cart-like rover capable of navigating its surroundings, mapping them, and picking up 
a simple object with some kind of lifting mechanism. The primary physical features of the rover are a chassis to 
which everything is mounted, 4(?) wheels direct-driven by individual 12v DC motors, a main control/processing hub board, 
a battery pack for power, 4 sonic sensors, and some kind of grabbing/lifting/dragging mechanism with its corresponding power 
and motor components. The processing is being run on an Arduino mega R3 board. Mapping is being achieved through the sonic 
sensors, component# HS-SR04.
